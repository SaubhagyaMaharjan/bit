			The ultimate target of an educational institution is to enhance the performance of every student. This can promptly be achieved by analyzing the performance of each student using competent analytic tools such as a dashboard. The information thus obtained can be deployed for taking effective as well as corrective measures to help them in performing better and realizing their potential. If not done systematically, this process may become time consuming and tedious. Student Information System (SIS) assists the institutions to manage every single detail about students in a holistic, organized and cost-effective way. Education ERP completely and efficiently eliminates the need of faculty members to spend a considerable amount of time in compiling student data. Thereby assisting the faculty members in channelizing their concentration on the students and their performance enhancement.
